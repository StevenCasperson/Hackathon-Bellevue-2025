# Human-in-the-Loop Data Analysis Pipeline 🤖👥

**Hackathon Project - October 4th, 2025**  
**Theme:** Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)  
**Team:** TattleTale

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive Human-in-the-Loop approach to data analysis and machine learning, showcasing effective collaboration between AI capabilities and human expertise.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Create an intelligent system where:
- **AI provides data insights and predictions**
- **Humans validate, correct, and guide the process**
- **Continuous feedback improves model performance**
- **Domain expertise enhances AI decision-making**

## 🏥🌱 Dual Track Implementation

### Healthcare Track
- Medical diagnosis assistance with doctor validation
- Patient risk assessment with clinical oversight
- Feature importance for medical decision support

### Sustainability Track  
- Energy consumption prediction with expert review
- Environmental monitoring with scientist validation
- Resource optimization with human guidance

## 🔄 HITL Pipeline Stages

1. **Interactive Data Selection** - Human chooses domain
2. **AI Quality Assessment** → Human cleaning approval
3. **AI Insight Generation** → Human EDA review
4. **AI Feature Engineering** → Human feature validation
5. **AI Model Recommendations** → Human model selection
6. **AI Predictions** → Human validation & feedback

## 💡 Key Innovations
